## installation

Clone this repo with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:call-me-matt/weeklyOSMnotifier.git`

On linux run setup.sh to get you started with all requirements for a python environment. 

First you should insert your secrets into the file `configs/private/secrets/weeklysecrets.yaml`.
You would need to create that file looking something like this:

```
runnable: False
mail_user: "somegmailusername"
mail_pw: "somegmailssecretpasswort"
forum_KEY: "abcdef123456"
mastondon_INSTANCE: "yourinstance.social"
mastodon_TOKEN: "yourMastodonDeveloperApplicationAccessToken"
tw_CONSUMER_KEY: "yourTwitterConsumerKey"
tw_CONSUMER_SECRET: "yourTwitterConsumerSecretFrdsfor09512kljda98324iu21as"
tw_ACCESS_KEY: "123456-YourTWAccessKeyNelsonMandela4Evaaaa"
tw_ACCESS_SECRET: "YourTWAccessSecretlsdkhjkahdkjahsrwqkjhqwkjhewqkjewqh"
telegram_TOKEN: "YourTelegramBotToken123:456"
josm_user: "yourJosmWikiUser"
jsom_pw: "yourJosmWikiPass"
``` 

Next you should define the recipients for each language in a `weekly_*.yaml` as defined in your `configs/configs.yaml`

```
mail_to: 
 - "testaccout@gmail.com"
 - "someone@gmail.com"
 - "another@one.com"
 - "talk-pt@openstreetmap.org"
 - "talk-br@openstreetmap.org"

 forum_to: "123456" # posts into https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/some-title/123456/
                    # only one thread possible per language due to forum's antispam

 telegram_to: # send telegram messages to the following recipients (if group, bot must be admin)
  - -123456789 # groups have negative identifiers
  - -987654321
 
 mastodon_to:  # send mastodon direct toots to the following recipients
  - "@user@instance"
  - "@other@instance"

```
## Adding a new language xx 

1. in your `configs.yaml` add two lines for the xx language
```
- weekly_xx.yaml:
  - private/mailto/weekly_xx.yaml
```
2. create `weekly_xx.yaml` in the `configs`-folder. content: text bodies of notifications in xx
3. in your `configs/private/mailto`-folder, create `weekly_xx.yaml`. content: notification recipients for xx

If you copy from another language, don't forget to change the language_header

## Utilization

For calling this from a script within the prepared environment call the shellscript `runenvweekly2all.sh`.
It takes the same parameters as the python script but fixes PYTHONIOENCODING to UTF-8 and LC_CTYPE to C.UFT-8 avoiding issues when called from node or other environments.


test call - for twitter
```
./runenvweekly2all.sh --twitter --pic ~/downloads/C3wrVxcWcAEhtrU.jpg --showpic  "WEEKLYTWTEST" "en,de,fr"
```

how to call - mail, forum, josm, telegram, mastodon and twitter
```
./runenvweekly2all.sh --mail --forum --josm --telegram --mastodon --twitter --pic auto --showpic  "WEEKLY" "int,en,ja,ko,zh,id,ru,uk,pl,it,pt,br,es,fr,de"
```
